<p>As 2024 draws to a close, the Open Source Initiative (OSI) reflects on an eventful year marked by significant achievements in advocating for Open Source principles in policy and standards development worldwide. Below, we highlight key milestones, initiatives and ongoing work from the year.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Global engagements</h3>



<p><strong><a href="https://opensource.org/blog/exploring-openness-in-ai-insights-from-the-columbia-convening" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Columbia Convening on AI</a></strong>: Led by the Mozilla Foundation and the Columbia Institute of Global Politics, OSI participated in this collaboration to build a framework for openness in AI. The convening produced technical and policy memorandums advancing the discourse on open and equitable AI development.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://opensource.org/blog/osi-at-the-united-nations-ospos-for-good" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">United Nations “OSPOs for Good”</a></strong>: OSI participated in a panel on this NYC event, emphasizing Open Source’s role in defining Open Source AI. Collaborative discussions underscored the growing recognition of Open Source in global governance.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://opensource.org/blog/highlights-from-our-participation-at-open-source-congress-2024" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Open Source Congress</a></strong>: OSI participated in the second Open Source Congress, hosted in Beijing by the Open Atom Foundation. This event fostered collaboration among nonprofit leaders in the Open Source ecosystem.</p>



<p><a href="https://opensource.org/blog/highlights-from-the-digital-public-goods-alliance-annual-members-meeting-2024" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA</strong>)</a>: OSI continued its active role as a member of the DPGA, contributing to the Annual Members Meeting held in Singapore. The event highlighted OSI’s involvement in promoting open standards, software and AI models as part of the global ecosystem of Digital Public Goods.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">European policy work</h3>



<p><strong><a href="https://opensource.org/blog/tag/cra" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Cyber Resilience Act (CRA</a>)</strong>: After having successfully helped the community to understand the challenges of the first draft of the Cyber Resilience act, OSI’s focus shifted to implementation in the second half of the year, joining the Eclipse Open Regulatory Compliance Group, a group designed to help Open Source developers implement the CRA. In addition to this, we are preparing to work with European standardization organizations to ensure the standards developed for the CRA are implementable for Open Source developers.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://opensource.org/blog/tag/standards" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Standardization Advocacy</a></strong>: OSI provided feedback on the Standard Essential Patents Regulation and standardization frameworks, ensuring they align with Open Source principles. Efforts included ensuring software standards can be freely implemented by the community. In parallel to this, OSI is working to find ways to involve Open Source developers in the standardization process. OSI remains a member at ETSI and regularly engages with representatives of other standards bodies.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://opensource.org/blog/the-open-source-initiative-and-the-eclipse-foundation-to-collaborate-on-shaping-open-source-ai-osai-public-policy" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Collaboration with Eclipse Foundation</a></strong>: A Memorandum of Understanding with the Eclipse Foundation marked a strategic partnership to influence Open Source AI policy and the implementation of the Cyber Resilience Act.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://opensource.org/blog/tag/ai" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">AI Act Advocacy</a></strong>: After the introduction of an exemption for Open Source AI in the AI act, lawmakers have faced an unprecedented wave of openwashing in the AI space. OSI has expanded its educational efforts, meeting with lawmakers and staffers, presenting the Open Source AI Definition, and highlighting cases of openwashing. In addition to this, OSI was selected as one of the stakeholders for the drafting of the Code of Practice on General-Purpose AI, a set of rules designed to help companies comply with the AI act. OSI has used this opportunity to help address some of the challenges Open Source AI developers face, and to clearly differentiate between Open Source and open weight AI.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://opensource.org/blog/jordan-maris-joins-osi" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">New Appointments</a></strong>: OSI welcomed Jordan Maris as EU Policy Analyst, strengthening its advocacy presence in Brussels.</p>

OSI’s leadership in the OPA strengthened policy efforts across the U.S., including invited participation roundtables with federal agencies, responding to public calls for comments on security, sustainability and open source AI models, educating policymakers on Open Source’s societal benefits, and securing philanthropic support for Open Source policy initiatives.</p>
