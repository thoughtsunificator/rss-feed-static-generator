<p>At Alphabet, open source remains a critical component of our business and internal systems. We depend on thousands of upstream projects and communities to run our infrastructure, products, and services. Within the Open Source Programs Office (OSPO), we continue to focus on investing in the sustainability of open source communities and expanding access to open source opportunities for contributors around the world. As participants in this global ecosystem, our goal with this report is to provide transparency and to report our work within and around open source communities.</p>

<p>In 2023 roughly 10% of Alphabet’s full-time workforce actively contributed to open source projects. This percentage has remained roughly consistent over the last five years, indicating that our open source contribution has remained proportional to the size of Alphabet over time. Over the last 5 years, Google has released more than 7,000 open source elements, representing a mix of new projects, features, libraries, SDKs, datasets, sample code, and more.</p><br>
  
<h2><b>Most open source projects we contribute to are outside of Alphabet</b></h2>

<p>In 2023, employees from Alphabet interacted with more than 70,000 public repositories on GitHub. Over the last five years, more than 70% of the non-personal GitHub repositories receiving Alphabet contributions were outside of Google-managed organizations. Our top external projects (by number of unique contributors at Alphabet) include both Google-initiated projects such as <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Kubernetes</a>, <a href="https://beam.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Apache Beam</a>, and <a href="https://grpc.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">gRPC</a> as well as community-led projects such as <a href="https://llvm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LLVM</a>, <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Envoy</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">web-platform-tests</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to Alphabet employees supporting external projects, in 2023 Alphabet-led projects received contributions from more than 180,000 non-Alphabet employees (unique GitHub accounts not affiliated with Alphabet).</p><br>
  
<h2><b>Open source remains vital to industry collaboration and innovation</b></h2>

<p>As the technology industry turns to focus on novel AI and machine learning technologies, open source communities have continued to serve as a shared resource and avenue for collaboration on new frameworks and emerging standards. In addition to launching new projects such as <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/search?updated-max=2023-11-08T09:00:00-08:00&amp;max-results=3&amp;start=6&amp;by-date=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Project Open Se Cura</a> (an open-source framework to accelerate the development of secure, scalable, transparent and efficient AI systems), we also collaborated with AI/ML industry leaders including Alibaba, Amazon Web Services, AMD, Anyscale, Apple, Arm, Cerebras, Graphcore, Hugging Face, Intel, Meta, NVIDIA, and SiFive to <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/03/openxla-is-ready-to-accelerate-and-simplify-ml-development.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">release OpenXLA</a> to the public for use and contribution. <a href="https://openxla.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OpenXLA</a> is an open source ML compiler enabling developers to train and serve highly-optimized models from all leading ML frameworks on all major ML hardware. In addition to technology development, Google’s OSPO has been supporting the OSI's <a href="https://opensource.org/blog/open-source-ai-definition-where-it-stands-and-whats-ahead" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Open Source AI definition initiative</a>, which aims to clearly define 'Open Source AI' by the end of 2024.</p><br>

<h2><b>Investing in the next generation of open source contributors</b></h2>
  
<p>As a longstanding consumer and contributor to open source projects, we believe it is vital to continue funding both established communities as well as invest in the next generation of contributors to ensure the sustainability of open source ecosystems. In 2023, OSPO provided $2.4M in sponsorships and membership fees to more than 60 open source projects and organizations. Note that this value only represents OSPO's financial contribution; other teams across Alphabet also directly fund open source work. In addition, we continue to support our longstanding programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>In its 19th year, <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Google Summer of Code</a> (GSoC) enabled more than 900 individuals to contribute to 168 organizations. Over the lifetime of this program, more than 20,000 individuals from 116 countries have contributed to more than 1,000 open source organizations across the globe.</li></ul><ul>
<li>In its fifth year, <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Google Season of Docs</a> provided direct grants to 13 open source projects to improve open source project documentation. Each organization also created a <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/2023/participants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">case study</a> to help other open source projects learn from their experience.</li></ul><ul> 
<li>In 2023, the <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/12/google-open-source-peer-bonus-program-announces-second-group-of-2023-winners.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Google Open Source Peer Bonus Program</a> gave awards to 163 non-Alphabet contributors from the broader open source community representing 35 different countries.</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Securing our shared supply chain remains a priority</b></h2>

<p>We continue to invest in improving the security posture of open source projects and ecosystems. Since <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/12/announcing-oss-fuzz-continuous-fuzzing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">launching in 2016</a>, Google's free <a href="https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OSS-Fuzz</a> code testing service has helped discover and get over <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?q=status%3AFixed%2CVerified%20Type%3DBug-Security&amp;can=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">10000</a> vulnerabilities and <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?q=status%3AFixed%2CVerified%20Type%3DBug&amp;can=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">34,000</a> bugs fixed across more than  <a href="https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1200</a> projects. In 2023, we added features, expanded our OSS-Fuzz Rewards Program, and continued our support for academic fuzzing research. In <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/02/taking-next-step-oss-fuzz-in-2023.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">2023</a>, we also <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/08/ai-powered-fuzzing-breaking-bug-hunting.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">applied</a> the generative power of LLMs to improve fuzz testing. In addition to this project we’ve been:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Collaborating on resources and frameworks:</b> We’ve continued to support and participate in the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), which <a href="https://openssf.org/press-release/2023/04/19/openssf-announces-slsa-version-1-0-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">announced the release of SLSA v1.0</a>, a framework that provides specifications for software supply chain security. We also supported the development of the <a href="https://openssf.org/blog/2023/10/12/introducing-openssfs-malicious-packages-repository/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">malicious packages repository</a>, the first open source system for collecting and publishing cross-ecosystem reports of malicious packages, and added <a href="https://openssf.org/blog/2023/08/28/openssf-scorecard-launches-v4-12-with-support-for-gitlab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitLab support</a> in v4.12 of Scorecard. The <a href="https://github.com/ossf/osv-schema" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OSV Vulnerability Schema</a> has continued to see <a href="https://osv.dev/blog/posts/2023-in-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">strong organic adoption</a>, with <a href="https://osv.dev/blog/posts/2023-in-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8 new ecosystems</a> adopting the format and publishing records for inclusion in <a href="http://osv.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OSV.dev</a>.</li></ul><ul>
<li><b>Investing in tooling to increase trust and transparency:</b> In 2023, Google’s Open Source Security Team (GOSST) helped to fund the launch of <a href="https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2023-04-20-introducing-trusted-publishers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Trusted Publishing for PyPI</a> and supported the rollout of <a href="https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2024-01-01-2fa-enforced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">2FA enforcement</a> across PyPI. GOSST also supported the launch of <a href="https://blog.sigstore.dev/npm-provenance-ga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sigstore-powered provenance in npm</a> and other sigstore clients like Python to milestone <a href="https://blog.sigstore.dev/announcing-sigstore-python-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">releases</a>. We also released <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/09/capslock-what-is-your-code-really.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Capslock</a>, a capability analysis CLI tool that informs users of privileged operations (like network access and arbitrary code execution) in a given package and its dependencies, <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/08/toward-quantum-resilient-security-keys.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">quantum resilient security keys</a> as part of <a href="https://github.com/google/OpenSK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OpenSK</a> (our open source security key firmware), and increased free public access to package dependency data through <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/04/announcing-depsdev-api-critical.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">deps.dev’s new API</a>.</li></ul><ul> 
<li><b>Helping more projects adopt security best practices as well as identify and remediate vulnerabilities:</b> Over the last year, the upstream team has proposed <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/04/googles-open-source-security-upstream-team-one-year-later.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">security improvements</a> to more than 181 critical open source projects including widely-used projects such as NumPy, etcd, XGBoost, Ruby, TypeScript, LLVM, curl, Docker, and more. In addition to this work, GOSST continues to support <a href="https://github.com/google/osv-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OSV-Scanner</a> to help projects find existing vulnerabilities in their dependencies, and enable comprehensive detection and remediation by providing commit-level vulnerability detail for over <a href="https://osv.dev/blog/posts/introducing-broad-c-c++-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">30,000 existing CVE records from the NVD</a>. </li>
</ul>

<p>Our open source work will continue to grow and evolve to support the changing needs of our communities. Thank you to our colleagues and community members who continue to dedicate personal and professional time supporting the open source ecosystem. Follow our work at opensource.google.</p><br>

<h3><b>Appendix: About this data</b></h3>

<p>This report features metrics provided by many teams and programs across Alphabet. In regards to the code and code-adjacent activities data, we wanted to share more details about the derivation of those metrics. 
</p><ul>
<li><b>Data sources:</b> These data represent the activities of Alphabet employees on public repositories hosted on GitHub and our internal production Git service Git-on-Borg. These sources represent a subset of open source activity currently tracked by Google OSPO.</li><ul><ul>
<li><b>GitHub:</b> We continue to use GitHub Archive as the primary source for GitHub data, which is available as a public dataset on BigQuery. Alphabet activity within GitHub is identified by self-registered accounts, which we estimate underreports actual activity.</li></ul></ul><ul><ul>
<li><b>Git-on-Borg:</b> This is a Google managed <a href="https://opensource.google/documentation/reference/glossary#git-on-borg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">git service</a> which hosts some of our larger, long running open source projects such as Android and Chromium. While we continue to develop on this platform, most of our open source activity has moved to GitHub to increase exposure and encourage community growth.</li></ul></ul>
<li><b>Driven by humans:</b> We have created many automated bots and systems that can propose changes on various hosting platforms. We have intentionally filtered these data to focus on human-initiated activities.</li></ul><ul>
<li><b>Business and personal:</b> Activity on GitHub reflects a mixture of Alphabet projects, third-party projects, experimental efforts, and personal projects. Our metrics report on all of the above unless otherwise specified.</li></ul><ul>
<li><b>Alphabet contributors: </b>Please note that unless additional detail is specified, activity counts attributed to Alphabet open source contributors will include our full-time employees as well as our extended Alphabet community (temps, vendors, contractors, and interns). In 2023, full time employees at Alphabet represented more than 95% of our open source contributors.</li></ul><ul>
<li><b>GitHub Accounts:</b> For counts of GitHub accounts not affiliated with Alphabet, we cannot assume that one account is equivalent to one person, as multiple accounts could be tied to one individual or bot account.</li></ul><ul>
<li><b><sup>*</sup>Active counts:</b> Where possible, we will show ‘active users’ defined by logged activity (excluding ‘WatchEvent’) within a specified timeframe (a month, year, etc.) and ‘active repositories’ and ‘active projects’ as those that have enough activity to meet our internal active-project criteria and have not been archived.</li></ul>
