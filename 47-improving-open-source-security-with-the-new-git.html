<p>The Open Source community underpins much of today’s software innovation, but with this power comes responsibility. Security vulnerabilities, unclear licensing, and a lack of transparency in software components pose significant risks to software supply chains. Recognizing this challenge, GitHub recently announced the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund—a transformative initiative aimed at bolstering the security and sustainability of Open Source projects.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the Secure Open Source Fund?</strong></h4>



<p>Launched with a $1.25 million commitment from partners, the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/announcing-github-secure-open-source-fund/" rel="noreferrer">GitHub Secure Open Source Fund</a> is designed to address a critical issue: the often-overlooked necessity of security for widely-used Open Source projects. The fund not only provides financial support to project maintainers but also delivers a comprehensive suite of resources, including but-not-limited-to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Hands-on security training</strong>: A three-week program offering mentorship, workshops, and expert guidance.</li>



<li><strong>Community engagement</strong>: Opportunities to connect with GitHub’s Security Lab, sponsors, and other maintainers.</li>



<li><strong>Funding milestones</strong>: $10,000 per project, tied to achieving key security objectives.</li>
</ul>



<p>The program’s cohort-based approach fosters collaboration and equips maintainers with the skills, networking, and funding to enhance the security of their projects sustainably.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why this matters</strong></h4>



<p>The success of Open Source hinges on its trustworthiness. For developers and organizations, the ability to confidently adopt and integrate Open Source projects is paramount. However, without sufficient security measures and transparency, these projects risk introducing vulnerabilities into the software supply chain. GitHub’s Secure Open Source Fund directly tackles this issue by empowering maintainers with the knowledge, community, and funding to make their projects secure and reliable.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Building trust through transparency</strong></h4>



<p>The GitHub Secure Open Source Fund aligns with the global push for greater transparency and resilience in software supply chains between creators and consumers of Open Source software. Its focus on security addresses growing concerns highlighted by regulations such as the EU’s Cyber Resilience Act and US Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). By providing maintainers vital funding to prioritize focused-time and with resources to identify and address vulnerabilities, the program strengthens the foundation of Open Source ecosystems.</p>



<p>GitHub has taken an ecosystem-wide approach, where resources and security go hand in hand. The Open Source Initiative (OSI) was invited to become a launch ecosystem partner, and we hope to contribute with valuable input, feedback, and ideas along with other community members. One of our projects, <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.clearlydefined.io/" rel="noreferrer">ClearlyDefined</a>, helps organizations to manage SBOMs at scale for each stage on the supply chain by providing easy access to accurate licensing metadata for Open Source components. Together, we hope to foster greater transparency and security for the entire supply chain.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A call to action for the Open Source community</strong></h4>



<p>As GitHub leads the charge with its Secure Open Source Fund, it’s crucial for the broader community to step up. Here’s how you can get involved:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Learn more about security</strong>: Gain access to workshops, group sessions, and mentorship.</li>



<li><strong>Maximize transparency</strong>: Adopt tools like ClearlyDefined to ensure clear metadata for your components.</li>



<li><strong>Advocate for funding</strong>: Support initiatives that prioritize security, whether through sponsorship or advocacy.</li>
</ul>



<p>Together, we can create a safer, more transparent, and more sustainable Open Source ecosystem.</p>
