<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Google Season of Docs</a> provides support for open source projects to improve their documentation and gives professional technical writers an opportunity to gain experience in open source. Together we improve developer experience through better documentation, increase our understanding of best practices in open source documentation, and raise the profile of technical writers in open source.</p>

<p>For 2024, Google Season of Docs is pleased to announce that eleven organizations will be participating in the program! The <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">list of participating organizations</a> can be viewed on the website.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/admin-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">project development phase</a> now begins. Organizations and the technical writers they hire will work on their documentation projects from now until November 22nd. For organizations still looking to hire a technical writer, <b>the hiring deadline is May 22nd</b>.</p><br>

<h2><b>How do I take part in Google Season of Docs as a technical writer?</b></h2>

<p>Start by reading the <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/tech-writer-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">technical writer guide</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FAQs</a> which give information about eligibility and choosing a project. Next, technical writers interested in working with accepted open source organizations can share their contact information via the <a href="https://github.com/google/season-of-docs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Season of Docs GitHub repository</a>; or they may submit a <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/tech-writer-statement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">statement of interest</a> directly to the organizations. We recommend technical writers reach out to organizations before submitting a statement of interest to discuss the project theyâ€™ll be working on and gain a better understanding of the organization. Technical writers do not need to submit a formal application through Google Season of Docs, so reach out to the organizations as soon as possible!</p><br>

<h2><b>Will technical writers be paid while working with organizations accepted into Google Season of Docs?</b></h2>

<p>Yes. Participating organizations will transfer funds directly to the technical writer via OpenCollective. Technical writers should review the organization's proposed project budgets and discuss their compensation and payment schedule with the organization before hiring. Check out our <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/tech-writer-payments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">technical writer payment process guide</a> for more details.</p><br>
