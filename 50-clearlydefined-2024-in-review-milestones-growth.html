<p>As 2024 draws to a close, it’s time to reflect on a transformative year for the ClearlyDefined project. From technical advancements to community growth, this year has been nothing short of extraordinary. Here’s a recap of our key milestones and how we’ve continued to bring clarity to the Open Source ecosystem.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>ClearlyDefined 2.0: expanding license coverage</strong></h3>



<p>This year, we launched <strong>ClearlyDefined v2.0</strong>, a major milestone in improving license data quality. By integrating support for <strong>LicenseRefs</strong>, we expanded beyond the SPDX License List, enabling organizations to navigate complex licensing scenarios with ease. Thanks to contributions from the community and leadership from GitHub and SAP, this release brought over 2,000 new licenses into scope. Dive into the details<a href="https://opensource.org/blog/clearlydefined-v2-0-adds-support-for-licenserefs" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"> here</a>.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New harvester for Conda packages</strong></h3>



<p>In response to the growing needs of the data science and machine learning communities, we introduced a new <strong>harvester for Conda packages</strong>. This implementation ensures comprehensive metadata coverage for one of the most popular package managers. Learn more about this update<a href="https://opensource.org/blog/better-identifying-conda-packages-with-clearlydefined" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"> here</a>.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Integration with GUAC for supply chain transparency</strong></h3>



<p>Our partnership with GUAC (Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition) from OpenSSF took supply chain observability to new heights. By integrating <strong>ClearlyDefined’s license metadata</strong>, GUAC users now have access to enriched data for compliance and security. This collaboration underscores the importance of a unified Open Source supply chain.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Community growth and governance</strong></h3>



<p>In 2024, we took significant steps toward a more open governance model by electing leaders to the <strong>Steering and Outreach Committees</strong>. These committees are pivotal in driving technical direction and expanding community engagement. Meet our new leaders <a href="https://opensource.org/blog/clearlydefineds-steering-and-outreach-committees-defined" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Showcasing ClearlyDefined globally</strong></h3>



<p>We showcased ClearlyDefined’s mission and impact across three continents:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>At <strong>FOSS Backstage</strong> and <strong>ORT Community Days</strong> in Berlin, we connected with industry leaders to discuss best practices for software compliance.</li>



<li>At <strong>SOSS Fusion 2024</strong> in Atlanta, we presented our collaborative approach to license compliance alongside GitHub and SAP.</li>



<li>At <strong>Open Compliance Summit</strong> in Tokyo, we showcased how Bloomberg leverages ClearlyDefined in order to detect and manage Open Source licenses.</li>
</ul>



<p>Each event reinforced the global importance of a transparent Open Source ecosystem.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Revamped Online Presence</strong></h3>



<p>To welcome new contributors and support existing ones, we unveiled a <strong>new website</strong> featuring comprehensive documentation and resources. Whether you’re exploring our guides, engaging in forums, or diving into the project roadmap, the platform is designed to foster collaboration.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Looking ahead to 2025</strong></h3>



<p>As we celebrate these achievements, we’re already planning for an even more impactful 2025. From enhancing our tools to expanding our community, the future of ClearlyDefined looks brighter than ever.</p>



<p>Thank you to everyone who contributed to our success this year.
