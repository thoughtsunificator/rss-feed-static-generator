<p>As we <a target="_blank" href="https://www.perforce.com/press-releases/perforce-launches-2025-state-of-open-source-survey" rel="noreferrer">announced back in September</a>, the OSI has partnered again with OpenLogic by Perforce to produce a comprehensive report on global, industry-wide Open Source software adoption trends. The 2025 State of Open Source Report will be based on responses to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.research.net/r/SLQWZGF" rel="noreferrer">a survey</a> of those working with Open Source software in their organizations, from developers to CTOs and everyone in between.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is our fourth year being involved in the State of Open Source Report, and there is never any shortage of surprises in the data,” says Stefano Maffulli, Executive Director, Open Source Initiative. “Now, however, the aim of the survey is not to determine whether or not organizations are using Open Source — we know they are — but to find out how they are handling complexities related to AI, licensing, and of course, security.”</p>



<p>This year, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.research.net/r/SLQWZGF" rel="noreferrer">the survey</a> includes new sections on Big Data, the impact of CentOS EOL, and security/compliance. As always, there are questions about technology usage in various categories such as infrastructure, cloud-native, frameworks, CI/CD, automation, and programming languages. Finally, a few questions toward the end look at Open Source maturity and stewardship, including sponsoring or being involved with open source foundations and organizations like OSI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, any report like this is only as valuable as its data and the more robust and high-quality the dataset, the stronger the report will be. As stewards of the Open Source community, OSI members are encouraged to take <a target="_blank" href="https://www.research.net/r/SLQWZGF" rel="noreferrer">the survey</a> so that the 2025 State of Open Source Report accurately reflects the interests, concerns, and preferences of Open Source software users around the world.&nbsp;</p>
