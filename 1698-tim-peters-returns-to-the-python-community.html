		<div id="content"><p></p>In the past, suspensions of Python core developers have effectively been
permanent because the recipients of the punishment chose not to return.
Things have played out quite differently after Tim Peters was <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/988894/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">suspended for three months</a> back in August;
Peters has been posting to the Python discussion forum since his suspension
ended in early November and, generally, getting back to work as usual.
That does not mean that he—or others in the community—have accepted the way
he was treated, but he has largely made his peace with it.  The incident is
still reverberating through the Python world, however.
